<p>
Maize is one of the important foods, green forage & industrial crops of the world. It is called QUEEN OF THE CEREALS. Maize has highest
 yield/ha among the cereal crops. 

<p>
<h3>Climate</h3>
Maize is a tropical plant which prefers warm humid weather. It is a short-day plant. It is very sensitive to excess or deficit soil
 moisture. It cannot with stand frost at any stage of growth. The optimum pH range of soil for maize is 6.5-7.5. 600 mm rainfall with 
even distribution is sufficient for good cultivation. Optimum temperatures for germination are 21℃ and for growth is 32℃ respectively.

<p>
<h3>Water Management</h3>
The optimum available soil moisture for maize crop is 75% or 80%. 

The frequency of irrigation will be once in 6-10 days depending upon rainfall. The total water requirement varies from 530mm to 800mm 
depending upon season & rainfall received during the crop growth crop period. 

Light & frequent irrigations just to moisten the effective root zone of the maize crop viz., 15cm to 22.5cm depth of soil are more 
conductive to higher yield. 

Up to 40 DAS, the crop is more sensitive to excess moisture & from pre-flowering to maturity, it is more sensitive to drought.
