<h3>Seeds and Sowing</h3>
Seed treatment: Seed should be treated with Thiram or Captan @2.5 g per kg of seed.
<br>
<br> 

Seed should be soaked in water before sowing so that you can observe good seed germination. This is best done by wrapping the seed with moist gunny sack. 
</p>
<p>
<h3>Manures and fertilizers</h3>
12-15 tons FYM/ha should be applied. 

Nitrogen required is 30-60kg/ha for dry land and 100-120 kg/ha under irrigated conditions. It has to be applied through Ammonium Sulphate. So, that plant can get both Nitrogen & Sulphur. 
<br>
Phosphorus required is 20kg/ha for rainfed and 50 kg/ha for irrigated crop. It has to be applied from Single Super Phosphate (SSP). So, that plant can get both Phosphorous & Sulphur. 
<br>
Potassium 20kg/ha is applied only for highly k deficient soils. 
<br>
Half of N at sowing & the remaining at first irrigation. Whole P& K to be applied at the time of sowing.
