<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>

<section>
<p>
Modern Agriculture covers a broad scope of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary fields that encompass the parts of natural, economic 
and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. The scope ranges from agricultural engineering to 
informatics, agroecosystems, biotechnology, soil, chemistry, breeding of crops, livestock and aquaculture etc. The content will provide 
a holistic view of the innovative agriculture and the wider societal impact of agricultural innovations thus touching on solutions to 
grand social challenges for sustainable development.

<h2>IMPACT OF MODERN AGRICULTURE</h2>
<p>
As we know that modern agriculture improved our affordability of food, increases the food supply, ensured the food safety, increases 
sustainability, and also produces more biofuels. But at the same time, it also leads to environmental problems because it is based on 
high input–high output technique using hybrid seeds of high-yielding variety and abundant irrigation water, fertilizers, and pesticides.
 The impacts of modern agriculture on the Environment are discussed below:
</p>
<h2>SOIL EROSION</h2>
<p>The top fertile soil of the farmland is removed due to the excessive water supply. This leads to the loss of nutrient-rich soil that
 hampered productivity. It also causes global warming because the silt of water bodies induces the release of soil carbon from the
 particulate organic material.<br>

<h2>Contamination of groundwater</h2>
<p>
The groundwater is one of the important sources of water for irrigation. From agricultural fields, nitrogenous fertilizers leach into 
the soil and finally contaminate groundwater. When the nitrate level of groundwater exceeds 25 mg/l, they can cause a serious health
 hazard known as “Blue Baby Syndrome”, which affects mostly infants even leading to their death.

<h2>Water-logging and salinity</h2>
<p>
The salinity of the soil is one of the reasons of low productivity just because of the improper management of farm drainage. In this 
situation, the roots of plants do not get enough air to respiration then it leads to low crop yield as well as low mechanical strength.
